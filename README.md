# Armenian Dictionary Search
This is a java program that searches for specific armenian words using user input using the '-' character.

There is a bug where you need to input your search condition multiple times to get an output. This could be an issue with the compiler not being able to consistently read Armenian characters.

It would be much appreciated if anyone added new words to the ArmenianWords.txt file. Thank you.
